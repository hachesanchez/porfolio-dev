                        I've recently embarked on an exciting journey of professional reinvention, transitioning into a full-stack MERN web developer, and really soon, into a DevOps engineer.

                        My journey began with an intensive nine-week bootcamp at Ironhack, Madrid. During this program, I dove headfirst into the world of web development, gaining proficiency in key technologies such as JavaScript, Node, Express, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and ReactJS.

                    <p className='overTheYears-text'>
                        My background is quite diverse; with a degree on journalism, I spent eight fulfilling years as a photographer and videographer, building my career between the corporate world and the social third sector. This unique blend of experiences has cultivated my creativity, adaptability, strong problem-solving skills, and a keen eye for detail.
