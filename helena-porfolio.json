For the back-end, I used Fly, a serverless deployment platform that allowed me to efficiently deploy the RESTful API and automatically scale based on demand. With Fly's deployment, a Dockerfile is created to build a Docker image containing the Node.js application. Build stages handle dependency installation, compilation of Node.js modules, and generating the necessary files. The final stage contains the application ready to run in a Docker container."
